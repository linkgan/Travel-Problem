    Description:
    I was searching for math brainteasers and came across this problem
    which was ranked as the hardest problem on braingle's website.

    The problem involves counting the number of paths from A to B where A and B
    are the outer nodes of a hexagon. The total number of outer vertices is 6.
    Each outer vertex is connected to other outer vertex via a straight path.

    Where these paths intersect, they form another node in the graph.
